    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="list">
        <ul>
            <li>Large Flat Skillet or Griddle (Nonstick or cast-iron preferred)</li>
            <li>A good spatula</li>
            <li>Whisk (Optional but I prefer it)</li> 
            <li>Metal Tongs</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>1 Fresh Lemon</li>
            <li>1-2 Eggs</li>
            <li>1/4-1/2 cup milk or cream</li>
            <li>1/4c Sugar (Optional depending on whether you want the bread to be sweet or you want it to be tart and compensate with sweet topings like syrup)</li>
            <li>Bread Slices (A thick cut Brioche is my fav but any will work generally)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp lemon extract (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract (Optional)</li>
            <li>Fresh Raspberries or other fresh berries (Optional Garnish)</li>
            <li>Maple Syrup (Optional Topping)</li>
            <li>Powdered Sugar (Optional Topping)</li>
            <li>Chocolate Sauce (Optional Topping)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <h5>If making this for one, use 1 egg, 1/4 cup milk/cream, and 1/8 cup of lemon juice, otherwise use the higher range from the ingredients list</h5>
    <div class="list">
        <ol>
            <li>Zest your lemon and add zest to a large mixing bowl</li>
            <li>Juice your lemon. I juice and then measure because too much lemon juice will affect texture. 1/8c to 1/4c is the range you're looking for for this. Add juice to bowl</li>
            <li>Add any lemon or vanilla extract you may optionally be using to the bowl and whisk.</li>
            <li>If you want your toast to be sweet, add the optional 1/4 cup sugar here and whisk until dissolved. If not, skip this step.</li>
            <li>Add your egg and milk to the mixture and whisk rapidly to fully combine/emulsify the mixture</li>
            <li>Add a pat of butter to your skillet on low-med heat (I prefer to use lower heat for longer times with french toast to avoid a raw center, but with a bit of skill higher temperatures can be used carefully to avoid burning)</li>
            <li>Dip your slices of bread into the mixture and make sure they fully absorb it, then add to the skillet and cover with a lid to allow steam to work on it without burning it.</li>
            <li>In a few minutes, peek under the edge with your spatula. You want a nice golden-brown texture. At this point, you can flip them and uncover for the rest of the cook.</li>
            <li>Once both sides are browned, you can serve. I like to plate them with fresh raspberries and maple or chocolate syrup, and an additional pat of butter on top.</li>
        </ol>
