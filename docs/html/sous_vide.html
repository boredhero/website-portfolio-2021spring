<h1>What's this Sous Vide thing all about?</h1>

<h3>Glad you asked, it's my favorite way to cook meat!</h3>

<h2>Basic Principles</h2>
<body>
    <i>Sous vide</i> is French for "under vacuum". It's an apt name for the process of sealing food in an airtight container and using precisely temperature controlled water to slowly cook that food.
    The water transfers heat to your food (without ever boiling). Because the temperatures are below boiling and the fat is submerged in a sealed container in a water bath, the <i>Maillard reaction</i>, which adds color and flavor to food, doesn't happen during the cook process.
    Now, that seems like a bad thing, but consider that when you grill a steak, unless you are going for a rare steak or roast, you will generally get some portion of your meat to "well done" because it has to cook conventionally long enough that the center reaches your desired internal temperature.
    Here, you can get your entire steak or roast up to your desired internal temperature that you'd have when it's done cooking without any overcookage of the area between the center and the outside.
    All you have to do is high temp sear or broil whatever you're cooking after you remove it from its container and you'll get a beautiful tasty crust on the outside without overcooking the inside.
    This is also nice for beginners and people who often over/undercook their steak because they're still getting a feel for how long things take. As an added perk, like most methods of slow cooking, it will lead to more tender meat than a more traditional cooking method, especially over time.
    If you leave something small in there too long it'll literally fall apart.

<h2>Is this safe?</h2>
<body>
    Now, you might be concerned about whether it is a safe to leave meat and other foods in a bath of water for hours on end.
    Fortunately, the answer is yes. What you are doing is essentially slow-pasturizing your food at a lower temperature. People often forget that the Pasteurization process has a time component as well as a temperature component.
    For instance, the temperatures for meat doneness that the FDA publishes are what is known as "instantaneous Pasteurization times", meaning that if the substance reaches that defined temperature at all, it is instantaneously Pasteurized.
    However, if you go lower in temperature, and you hold your substance there for a while, you will achieve the same level Pasteurization, just not instantaneously becuase you are using a lower temperature and it takes longer for any bad things to die off at a lower temperature.
    That said, it is still generally not advised to Sous vide anything longer than 12-24 hours. Not that you'd likely want to anyways, as it'll disintegrate at that point.

<h2>Selecting a Sous Vide Machine</h2>
<body>
    A good quality Sous Vide machine will set you back somewhere in the $100-200 range. Now, this is pricy for a cooking gadget, but they do make cooking meat a lot easier and provide some unique benefits as described above that I think make it worth the price. It's also a great gift for that person in your life who loves cooking if they don't already have one!
    Reasons to not skimp on cost are mostly about reliability. Remember, this is an electric heating element that will burn out eventually. The cheaper you go, realistically, the less cumulative hours of cooking you're going to get out of it before it is inconsistently heating the water or breaks entirely.
    The other thing you're paying for is wattage, which affects how much water you can practically heat. If you look at the specifications for most SV machines, they will usually list a max amount of water, in quarts or gallons, that they can heat effectively.
    My general recommendation for a beginner who wants a good quality SV machine towards the bottom end of the price range is to go with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anova-Culinary-Precision-Bluetooth-Included/dp/B07C7PW3PC/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=anova&qid=1619541697&sr=8-4">Anova Culinary Sous Vide Precision Cooker Nano - 750W - Bluetooth w App</a>.
    This is what I use. It's $99 on the dot, will heat a decent amount of water compared to some of the cheap 600W ones, and comes with bluetooth control and a very nice app that comes with temperature and time charts as well as recipes that you can use with it.
    If you want to splash down more, You can go for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anova-Culinary-AN500-US00-Precision-Included/dp/B07WQ4M5TS/ref=bmx_1?pd_rd_w=bes9E&pf_rd_p=b56a886c-2bb4-4e74-b4cf-23d7a76693c8&pf_rd_r=4E191AFDNXYWPY8C836T&pd_rd_r=d5c33718-6d25-4f29-afce-41455208bcfa&pd_rd_wg=AZ47Q&pd_rd_i=B07WQ4M5TS&psc=1">Anova AN500 Sous Vide Precision Cooker - 1000W - Wi-Fi with App</a>.
    This has more wattage and will work over wifi for better remote control (the bluetooth version isn't gonna work as well if you leave the room generally). 
    It does come in at the hefty cost of $194 on Amazon as of this writing. Anova also has a 1200W model but I can't recommend it as it's currently selling for almost $400, which it just isn't worth double the price for only 200W extra heating capacity.

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It's important that we remove as much air as possible from whatever medium we seal our food in (this is typically a freezer bag or you can use a freezer vacuum sealer). 
            If you have a ton of air in your bag, you aren't going to have good heat transfer from your heated water. It'll also cause your food to float, which is bad.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Sous vide concentrates flavors! A sprig of fresh thmye or a tiny bit of dried herbs go a long way, since the meat essentially cooks and marinates in its own juices and whatever else you add in there.</li>
            <br>
        <li>It isn't just for meat! You can sous vide egg bites, creme brulee (in little mason jars), and much more!</li>
            <br>
        <li>You don't need a vacuum sealer! You can use any good quality freezer zipper bags. Make sure you get FREEZER bags because the cheaper plastic regular bags are made of is not likely to remain water-tight during the SV immersion and you will also leach chemicals from them into your food!</li>
            <br>
        <li>An easy hack to get all the air out of a freezer zipper bag is to put everything in it, and then submerge it fully in your (not heated yet) water mostly closed. The water will compress the bag around the food, forcing the air out as you lower it closer and closer to the corner you have unzipped, which you can then quickly zip once there is no air left.</li>
            <br>
        <li>You can make a cheap roast tender by increasing SV immersion time. Just be careful you don't leave it too long or it'll disintegrate a bit more than you want and have a yucky texture.</li>
