    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="list">
        <ul>
            <li>Small Flat Skillet (Nonstick Preferred)</li>
            <li>Medium Pot (For cooking noodles)</li>
            <li>A nice olive oil of your choosing. </li>
            <li>6-12 Cloves of garlic (The more the better)</li>
            <li>Red Pepper Flakes (Optional, but recommended unless you hate spice)
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Fresh ground black pepper (can use pre-groumd, but use a bit more)</li>
            <li>1/8 Cup fresh chopped italian flat-leaf parsley OR 1 tsp dried parsley (see Proocedure #8 below for special treatment of the dried version)</li>
            <li>Noodle of your choice. Traditionally thin spaghetti, I prefer angel hair for this dish personally.</li>
            <li>Ground Parm/Romano (Fresh or Store shelf kind) (Optional, Garnish). I personally omit this, but you may prefer it.</li>
            <li>Peperoncino Peppers (Optional, Garnish) These are an optional garnish but I think the acidic brightness of the pepper contrasts excellently with the oiliness of the pasta</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>

    <div class="list">
        <ol>
            <li>Put salted water on high heat to boil noodles of your choice</li>
            <li>Peel your garlic cloves. Tip: Cut the ends off first with a knife and then it's easy to peel</li>
            <li>Carefully slice them as paper thin as you can get them.</li>
            <li>Add ~1/4 cup of your olive oil (must be enough to submerge your garlic) and use med heat</li>
            <li>Add garlic slices and Red Pepper Flakes. For a little heat, use 1/8-1/4 Tsp, for a lot, use up to 1 Tsp if you wanna feel the burn</li>
            <li>Watch carefully. You want them to just start to brown but not fully brown or you'll get a burnt taste.<li></li>
            <li>If done, take off heat and reserve until noodles are done.</li>
            <li>Just before straining noodles, reserve 1/8 cup hot pasta water. (If using dried parsley, add it to this to give it some time to hydrate)</li>
            <li>Strain noodles and DO NOT RINSE. 
            <li>Return noodles to their pot as well as the reserved water, parsley, and all of the oil and garlic from your skillet</li>
            <li>Liberally add salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Stir off-heat, make sure to combine everything. Taste to see if the salt/pepper ratio is to your liking, and tweak as necessary.</li>
            <li>Add any preferred garnishes (cheese, pepperoncinos, etc)</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
