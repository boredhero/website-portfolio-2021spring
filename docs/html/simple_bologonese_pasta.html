    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="list">
        <ul>
            <li>Large Flat Skillet (Nonstick Preferred)</li>
            <li>Medium-Large Saucepot</li>
            <li>Pot to cook noodles</li> 
            <li>1 large (28+oz) can crushed tomatoes (I like Cento)</li> 
            <li>1 can (6oz) tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 lb fresh ground beef (you can also use pork, sausage, or any ground meat you like here!) One of my fav variations is to use pork:beef 50/50</li>
            <li>1 Medium Onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>1 Carrot, shredded (or in a pinch, very finely diced)</li>
            <li>3-5 Cloves FRESH garlic, finely diced or thinly sliced (How much do you like garlic?)</li>
            <li>Olive Oil (or any flavorless oil in a pinch)</li>
            <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>~10 fresh basil leaves OR ~1 tbsp dried basil</li>
            <li>~2 sprigs fresh oregano leaves OR ~1 tbsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp-1 tsp red pepper flakes, or more if you want an arrabiata-like spicyness to your pasta sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh italian/flat leaf parsley, finely chopped, or 1 tsp dried parsley. NOT cilantro or curly. (Optional in a pinch)</li>
            <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>2 Bay leaves</li>
            <li>1/4 cup red or white wine you like (Optional, for deglazing rather than water)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pasta of your choosing (I like Penne or Thin Spaghetti)</li>
            <li>Ground Parm/Romano (Fresh or Store shelf kind). My personal favorite is pure freshly ground romanao with no parm, but YMMV</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <div class="list">
        <ol>
            <li>Add ground beef to a skillet and cook on high heat until well browned.</li>
            <li>Deglaze (Add liquid under high heat and scrape stuff on bottom of pan to dissolve it) with either water or the optional wine from above</li>
            <li>Set aside, off heat</li>
            <li>In your large pot that you're going to use for your sauce, add olive oil under medium heat</li>
            <li>Add onions and carrots, sauteeing until soft and translucent</li>
            <li>Add Garlic, Sugar, Fresh Herbs, Dry Herbs and spices</li>
            <li>Turn up heat a little and stir constantly until you start to get some browning on the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>Quickly add your crushed tomatoes (Rinse the can out with a bit of water and add that too, NOT a full can of water)
            <li>Scrape to deglaze the bottom, then add your tomato paste and scrape/deglaze bottom</li>
            <li>Add meat and stir</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil, and then turn heat down to the lowest setting on your lower burner, give a stir, and cover.</li>
            <li>Let simmer for AT LEAST 3 hours, but preferrably 4, 5, or even 6. Stirring and tasting hourly. The longer you cook this, the better its gonna taste.</li>
            <li>Follow noodle isntructions to cook noodles to your preferred doneness, making sure to salt your water!</li>
            <li>Strain but DO NOT RINSE your noodles. This may lead to them sticking together if left alone, but the starch helps the sauce stick and avoids puddles of water that may seperate out otherwise</li>
            <li>You can do one of two things here: Add a pat of butter to a skillet and add some noodles + sauce and combine well, frying a bit. OR Noodles on plate, sauce on top.</li>
            <li>Add your parm/romano on top and enjoy!
        </ol>
