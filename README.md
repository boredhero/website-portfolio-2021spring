# Cooking with Noah: Final Portfolio

This website is designed to be a showcase of some of my favorite recipes and you can actually cook some of the delicious things pictured in my previous assignment for this class.

## Final Portfolio

This website has been updated since the website unit! Goals for the final portfolio version are:

* Add a Services Page with the information from my visual unit project
* Add a Tools & Technique Page where I can write articles reviewing tools and explaining the technique
* Add at least one review of a product or explanation of at least one cooking technique or skill to the Tools & Technique page.
* Add a non-default cursor (Yes, like those old websites, cmon, you can't pretend it's not fun!)

## Web Unit

The web unit version of this website is still available under the `website_portfolio_assignment_old` branch of this repository.
